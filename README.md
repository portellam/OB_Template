# 1. What is Obsidian?
**The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.**

In Obsidian, the making and following of connections is frictionless. **Tend to your notes like a gardener;** at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

# 2. Description
The project *OB_Templates* is an <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> template repository.

Since the start of the project, there have been many changes. Since the beginning, it is a gathering place for my templates. Soon after, it became a project aimed at onboarding new users to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> - with a very important rule. **All templates must use only the core plugins of Obsidian**

In time, we found that the plugin <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">DataView</a> became an essential tool for every user. **The goal of the project is to keep it as basic as possible, so as to not confuse new users.**

All the available templates are not designed to be perfect. They are intended to be used as a reference for any user to build on them, or to inspire when building new templates.

# 3. Usage
*OB_Templates* is not a vault template, this is simply a folder of templates to be added in your vault. 

You can add the templates to your vault in different ways:
1. Download the repository, extract the files and add to your vault.
2. Go to a specific template and copy the text (Make sure you open in raw mode) and copy the text to a file in your vault.
